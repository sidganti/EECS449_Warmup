# EECS 449 Conversational AI Warmup

## Reflection

As someone who has experience with machine learning theory and minor analysis in python as well as experience building and maintaining webapps, this project was a nice introduction into blending the two concepts together. Since I had only built basic classification models in python I have never made a AI as capable as in this project. Jaseci seemed to be a quick way to put together the back end for a convesational ai application. I believe that if I had more time to play with the Jac language I could get better at it but at the moment I find python easier to use and understand. Also, as the platform gains popularity there will be more help resources available. Since I was able to start early I made quick progress. I was able to find some minor issues in the documentation and I contributed to fixing them. I think learning about the process of contributing to open source was the most valuable thing I learned even though my contribution was minor.
